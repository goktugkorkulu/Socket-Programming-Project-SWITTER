# Switter - Social Networking Application

Switter is a social networking application developed as part of the Sabanci University CS 408 - Computer Networks course project. It allows users to connect to a server and interact with other users through posting and viewing messages called "sweets". The application consists of client and server modules, each serving different purposes.

## Usage Instructions
To use the Switter application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., programming language runtime, GUI framework, etc.).
3. Compile and run the server module on a designated system. Specify the listening port through the Server GUI.
4. Compile and run the client module on other systems. Enter the server's IP address and the listening port via the Client GUI.
5. Each client should provide a unique username via the GUI, which will be used for identification.
6. Clients can then perform various operations such as posting sweets, requesting sweet feeds, following other users, blocking users, and more.
7. The server manages the storage and distribution of sweets and handles client connections and interactions.
8. All activities, including error messages, sweet postings, and feed requests, are displayed on both the client and server GUIs.
9. Remember to properly disconnect from the system by pressing the disconnect button or closing the client window.
